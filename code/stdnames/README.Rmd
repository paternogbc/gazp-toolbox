A reproducible protocol to standardize plant names following The Plant List database.

## Installation (development version)

devtoolss
``` r
devtools::install_github(repo = "paternogbc/gazp-toolbox", subdir = "code/stdnames")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(stdnames)
## basic example code
library(stdnames)

my_data <- species_data
# Stanardize species names within a comparative dataset
# First check and fix morphotypes
# check morphotypes
mf <- fix_morphotype(x = my_data$species)
mf[mf$morphotype == "yes", ]

# Replace morphotype names
my_data$species <- mf$corrected_binomial

# Run protocol to standardize plant names
out <- std_names(x = my_data, species_column = "species", id_label = "ID")

# Your original dataset plus corrected names (tpl_binomial)
# Remove head() for the complete output
head(out$std)

# Only submitted/corrected names
head(out$std_names)

# Complete output (with details on name standardization)
head(out$tpl_all)

# After removing duplicated names
head(out$tpl_clean)

# A higher taxonomy for the clean species list
head(out$taxonomy_clean)

# Names that failed to match the plant list
# In this case all names were included!
out$which_fail

# Names that were automatically corrected
# You must check if this is correct!
out$which_corrected

# Duplicated names after standardization
out$which_duplicated

# The complete output from TPL fuzzy matching
head(out$raw_tpl_out)

# Source data with unique identifiers for each row in the data.frame
head(out$source_data)
```
